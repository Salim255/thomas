# REACT HOOKS

## useActionState

- useActionState is a Hook that allows you to update state based on the result of a form action.

## useCallback

- useCallback is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.
- You should only rely on useCallback as a performance optimization. If your code doesn’t work without it, find the
- underlying problem and fix it first. Then you may add useCallback back.

## useContext

- useContext is a React Hook that lets you read and subscribe to context from your component.
